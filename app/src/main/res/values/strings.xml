        Assign clubs to NFC tags on your clubs so that during a round, tapping the tag against
        your phone will record a shot with that club at your current location. You can also
        assign \'Finish Hole\' to a tag that will record the hole location of where you
        (hopefully) made your last putt and will advance the app to the next hole. This tag could
        be worn on your glove, bracelet, etc.
        \n\
        \n\
        To assign a club to an NFC tag, select the \'Write\' mode button and select the club type
        you want to assign. Then, tap the NFC tag against the back of your phone and you will see
        a notification when the tag is assigned.
        \n\
        \n\
        To test a club tag that\'s already been assigned, select \'Read\' mode and then tap your
        club NFC tag against the phone. You\'ll see a notification about which club has been found.
